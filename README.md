# Your Project's Name
Project Name: Immersive DataCamp

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

This project overviews the integration of various modules into one, immersing in an interdisciplinary coordination to work together to come up with a high-quality design at the very end, and camps the required data into a single studio to collaborate.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## Design Process
 
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

3DF: Low Poly with UV Unwraps of COVID-19 Virus, render a 3D virus model with 3D modelling, UV unwrapping, & Arnold rendering, and bake textures & paint in Substance Painter, then export with Marmoset.
AD: Interactive XD mobile app based on COVID-19 with a consumer user experience.
GC: A proposed document of COVID-19 with willing and unwilling user types with reward loops and activities.
ID: Interactive web application of COVID-19 with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery languages with interface and animation.
PMT: Production management of the COVID-19 application with process.

## Technologies Used

3DF:
Maya: https://www.autodesk.com.sg/products/maya/overview, this is used to construct a 3D model, unwrap its UV, and Arnold render.
Substance Painter: https://www.substance3d.com/, this is used to bake the 3D model's textures and paint them.
Marmoset: https://marmoset.co/, this is used to animate the textured 3D model.

AD:
Adobe XD: https://www.adobe.com/sg/products/xd.html, this is used to design the wireframe and final product of the app.
Photoshop: https://www.adobe.com/sg/products/photoshop.html, this is used to design the app's assets.
Illustrator: https://www.adobe.com/sg/products/illustrator.html, same as Photoshop.

GC: Design Document, with gamified concepts with player types, rewards, and activities.

ID:
HTML: https://html.com/, this is used to define the webpage's content.
CSS: https://www.w3schools.com/css/, this is used to style the webpage to describe its presentation.
JavaScript: https://www.javascript.com/, this is used to make the webpage interactive to engage users.
JQuery: https://jquery.com/, this is used to simplify JavaScript programming to handle events, CSS, and Ajax.
Github: https://github.com/, this is used to commit ID repositories there as well as submission.

PMT:
Jira: https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira, this is used to track down progress of the application development.
Microsoft Teams: https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/microsoft-teams/log-in, this is used to conduct Standup/Retrospective Meetings to share user stories with tasks and bugs.

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
